# PyTorch Hook Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation of PyTorch hooks to traverse all modules of a ResNet model and print the shape of each layer's output. The hooks allow us to inspect the intermediate outputs of the model during forward propagation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aryafikriii/PyTorch-Hook-Implementation
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the jupyter source file and observe the printed output shapes of each layer.

```shell
hook.ipynb
```
